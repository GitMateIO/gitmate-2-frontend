    <h3>
      GitMate Press Kit
    </h3>
    <p>
      This page explains how you can use our logo and/or write about GitMate.io
      in public.
     </p>

     <h4>
       Textual Usage
     </h4>
     <p>Always spell GitMate with the proper casing.</p>
     <p>
       When using GitMate in without context, use <q>GitMate.io</q> to make it
       easy for people to understand what this is about.
     </p>
     <blockquote>
       By the way - I just found GitMate.io, a tool that automates issue
       triaging.
     </blockquote>

     <p>
       When referencing GitMate in longer texts with proper context, the
       <q>.io</q> is cumbersome and to be omitted.
       Especially if it is contextually clear what you refer to, the explicit
       reference is not needed.
     </p>
     <blockquote>
       Historically, the GitMate team has been working on automating a plethora
       of tedious tasks.
       To provide a focused product, they decided to focus on managing issues
       by applying their experiences with machine learning algorithms.
